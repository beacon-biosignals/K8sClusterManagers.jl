Workflow Patterns
=================

## Required Permissions

K8sClusterManagers.jl requires a minimal set of permisisons for managing worker _Pod_s within
the cluster. A minimal set of permissions is documented below along with a _Service Account_
to make use of these permissions:

````@eval
using Markdown
Markdown.parse("""
```yaml
$(read("julia-manager-serviceaccount.yaml", String))
```
""")
````

## Use K8sClusterManager only within cluster

Since the [`K8sClusterManager`](@ref) can only be used when running inside of a Kubernetes
_Pod_ you may want conditionally use it. The [`isk8s`](@ref) predicate provides a convenient
way of determining if the running Julia process is executing within a k8s _Pod_.

```julia
using Distributed, K8sClusterManagers

manager = if isk8s()
    K8sClusterManager(n)
else
    Distributed.LocalManager(n)
end

addprocs(manager; exeflags="--project")
```

## Executing a script

Depending on your use case you may find yourself wanting to execute a script on the k8s
cluster. One basic workflow would be as follows.

1. Write a "script.jl" which uses `K8sClusterManager`
2. Build and push a Docker image containing the "script.jl" and the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    docker build -t $IMAGE .
    docker push $IMAGE
    ```

3. Define a Kubernetes manifest ("script-example.template.yaml") which executes the Docker
   image on the cluster. Note that the use of `envsubst` will substitute `${...}` with the
   respectively named environmental variable.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      generateName: script-example-
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: "${PROJECT}-service-account"
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: manager
        image: "${IMAGE}"
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        command: ["julia", "script.jl"]
        args: ["${ARG}"]
    ```

4. Create the resource which will run our script.

    ```sh
    # Expects that `PROJECT`, `IMAGE`, and `ARG` are all predefined
    cat script-example.template.yaml | envsubst | kubectl create -f -
    ```
