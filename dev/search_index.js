Attempts to spawn np workers but may launch with less workers if the cluster has less resources available.\n\nArguments\n\nnp: Desired number of worker pods to be launched.\n\nKeywords\n\nnamespace: the Kubernetes namespace to launch worker pods within. Defaults to current_namespace().\nmanager_pod_name: the name of the manager pod. Defaults to ENV[\"HOSTNAME\"] which is the name of the pod when executed inside of a Kubernetes pod.\nimage: Docker image to use for the workers. Defaults to using the image of the Julia caller if running within a pod using a single container otherwise is a required argument.\ncpu: CPU resources requested for each worker. Defaults to 1,\nmemory: Memory resource requested for each worker in bytes. Requests may provide a unit suffix (e.g. \"G\" for Gigabytes and \"GiB\" for Gibibytes). Defaults to \"4Gi\".\npending_timeout: The maximum number of seconds to wait for a \"Pending\" worker pod to enter the \"Running\" phase. Once the timeout has been reached the manager will continue with the number of workers available (<= np). Defaults to 180 (3 minutes).\nconfigure: A function which allows modification of the worker pod specification before their creation.
