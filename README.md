A Julia cluster manager for provisioning workers in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster.

Pairs well with [julia_pod](https://github.com/beacon-biosignals/julia_pod) for k8s-native julia development.

## K8sClusterManager

The `K8sClusterManager` is intended to be used from a Pod running inside a Kubernetes
cluster.

Assuming you have `kubectl` installed locally and configured to connect to a cluster, you
can easily create an interactive Julia REPL session running from within the cluster by
executing:

```sh
kubectl run -it example-manager-pod --image julia:1
```

Or equivalently, using a K8s manifest named `example-manager-pod.yaml` containing:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-manager-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: manager
    image: julia:1
    stdin: true
    tty: true
```

and running the following commands will also create a Julia REPL running inside a Kubernetes
Pod:

```sh
kubectl apply -f example-manager-pod.yaml

# Once the pod is running
kubectl attach -it pod/example-driver-pod
```

Now in this Julia REPL session, you can do add two workers via:

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("K8sClusterManagers")

julia> using K8sClusterManagers

julia> addprocs(K8sClusterManager(2))
```

### Advanced configuration

`K8sClusterManager` exposes a `configure` keyword argument that can be used to make
modifications to the Pod manifest when defining workers.

When launching the cluster the function `configure(pod)` will be called where `pod` is an
dict-object representing the YAML/JSON Pod manifest. The function must return an object of
the same type. For example if you wanted to change the workers to require GPU resources you
could write the following:

```julia
function my_gpu_configurator(pod)
    worker_container = pod["spec"]["containers"][1]
    worker_container["resources"]["limits"]["nvidia.com/gpu"] = 1
    return pod
end
```

To get an example instance of `pod` objects that might be passed into the `configure`, call

```julia
using K8sClusterManagers, JSON
pod = K8sClusterManagers.worker_pod_spec(manager_name="example", image="julia", cmd=`julia`)
JSON.print(pod, 4)
```

## Useful Commands

Monitor the status of all your Pods
```sh
watch kubectl get pods,services
```

Stream the stdout of the worker "example-driver-pod-worker-9001":
```sh
kubectl logs -f pod/example-driver-pod-worker-9001
```

Currently cleaning up after / killing all your pods can be slow / ineffective from a Julia
context, especially if the driver Julia session dies unexpectedly. It may be necessary to
kill your workers from the command line.
```sh
kubectl delete pod/example-driver-pod-worker-9001 --grace-period=0 --force=true
```
It may be convenient to set a common label in your worker podspecs, so that you can select
them all with `-l='...'` by label, and kill all the worker Pods in a single invocation.

Display info about a Pod -- this is especially useful to troubleshoot a Pod that is taking
longer than expected to get up and running.
```sh
kubectl describe pod/example-driver-pod
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get `deserialize` errors during interations between driver and worker processes, make
sure you are using the same version of Julia on the driver as on all the workers!

If you aren't sure what went wrong, check the logs! The syntax is
```bash
kubectl logs -f pod/pod_name
```
where the Pod name `pod_name` you can get from `kubectl get pods`.

## Testing

The K8sClusterManagers package includes tests that are expect to have access to a Kubernetes
cluster. The tests should be able to be run in any Kubernetes cluster but have only been
run with [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/).

### Minikube

1. [Install Docker or Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. If using Docker Desktop: set the resources to a minimum of 3 CPUs and 2.25 GB Memory
3. [Install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
4. Start the Kubernetes cluster: `minikube start`
5. Use the in-cluster Docker daemon for image builds: `eval $(minikube docker-env)`
   (Note: only works with single-node clusters)
6. Run the K8sClusterManagers.jl tests
