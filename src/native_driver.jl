"""
    K8sClusterManager(np::Integer; kwargs...)

A cluster manager using Kubernetes (k8s) which spawns additional pods as workers. Attempts
to spawn `np` workers but may launch with less workers if the cluster has less resources
available.

## Arguments

- `np`: Desired number of worker pods to be launched.

## Keywords

- `namespace`: the Kubernetes namespace to launch worker pods within. Defaults to
  `current_namespace()`.
- `manager_pod_name`: the name of the manager pod. Defaults to `gethostname()` which is
  the name of the pod when executed inside of a Kubernetes pod.
- `worker_prefix`: the prefix given to spawned workers. Defaults to
  `"\$(manager_pod_name)-worker"` when the manager is running inside of K8s otherwise
  defaults to `"$(gethostname())-worker`.
- `image`: Docker image to use for the workers. Defaults to the image used by the manager
  when running inside of a K8s pod otherwise defaults to "julia:\$VERSION".
- `cpu`: [CPU resources requested](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu)
  for each worker. Defaults to `$(repr(DEFAULT_WORKER_CPU))`,
- `memory`: [Memory resource requested](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory)
  for each worker in bytes. Requests may provide a unit suffix (e.g. "G" for Gigabytes and
  "Gi" for Gibibytes). Defaults to `$(repr(DEFAULT_WORKER_MEMORY))`.
- `pending_timeout`: The maximum number of seconds to wait for a "Pending" worker pod to
  enter the "Running" phase. Once the timeout has been reached the manager will continue
  with the number of workers available (`<= np`). Defaults to `180` (3 minutes).
- `configure`: A function which allows modification of the worker pod specification before
  their creation. Defaults to `identity`.
